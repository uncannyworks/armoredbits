## Coding Guidelines

### Style

Please use the existing code base as a guideline.

- Spaces. Never tabs.
- Two space indents.
- 80 character column width.
- Never use partial functions. `head`, `tail`, `fromJust`, etc.

### Pull Requests

Please open an issue about what you intend to implement or solve and wait for a
core member to approve it.

If the issue was approved fork the repository, make your changes, and then open
a PR with a reference to the initial issue which was opened.

We want to avoid adding features which aren't on the roadmap, or that may
conflict with existing work.
